# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13

# Print the result of 13 added to 22

# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22

# Print the result of 22 mutiplied by 13

# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)

# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13

# Print the reminder of 22 divided by 13

firstop = 13 + 22
print(firstop)

secondop = 22 - 13
print(secondop)

thirdop = 22 * 13
print(thirdop)

fourthop = 22 / 13
print(fourthop)

fifthop = 22 // 13
print(fifthop)

sixthop = 22 % 13
print(sixthop)

seventhop = 22 ** 13
print(seventhop)

print(22 + 13)
