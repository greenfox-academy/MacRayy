# Write a program that stores 3 sides of a cuboid as variables (doubles)
# The program should write the surface area and volume of the cuboid like:
#
# Surface Area: 600
# Volume: 1000

a = 20.1
b = 20.1
c = 20.1

SurfaceArea = float(a * b * 6)

print(SurfaceArea)

volume = float(a * b * c)

print(volume)
