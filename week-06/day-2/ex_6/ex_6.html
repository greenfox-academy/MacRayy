                <p>Distance to power generators? One-seven, decimal two-eight. Target. Maximum fire power. Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon. But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!! Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop! How typical. Come on. Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident! Wait! Wait!
                So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever. We would be honored if you would join us. I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too.</p>

                <p>Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good. You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.</p>
                <p>Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone. Han! Leia! Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control. I saw...I saw a city in the clouds. Mmm. Friends you have there. They were in pain. It is the future you see. Future? Will they die? Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. I've got to go to them. Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.</p>

                <p>Apology accepted, Captain Needa. Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now. Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory. Yes, my lord. We'll find them. Don't fail me again, Admiral. Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.</p>
                <p>What did you have in mind for your next move? Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away. With the rest of the garbage. Then what? Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas? No. Where are we? The Anoat system. Anoat system. There's not much there. No.</p>
